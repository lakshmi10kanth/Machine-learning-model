Below is an outline of how you can accomplish each step of the task:

1. Preprocess the dataset
Load the dataset and encode the Membership_Level column using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Split the data into training and testing sets using sklearn's train_test_split.
2. Create a neural network model
Define a neural network architecture using TensorFlow or PyTorch. You can start with a simple architecture with fully connected layers.
Define the input shape based on the number of features in your dataset and the output shape based on the number of classes for membership levels.
3. Train the model
Compile the model with an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification) and optimizer.
Train the model on the training data using model.fit.
4. Version control with Git
Initialize a Git repository for your project.
Commit your code changes as you progress through the development stages.
5. Containerize the application with Docker
Write a Dockerfile to define the environment for your application. Include necessary dependencies such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask, etc.
Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
6. Create a Flask web service
Create a Flask web service to serve predictions using the trained model. Define an endpoint to accept input data and return predictions.
Load the trained model within the Flask app.
Implement request handling logic to preprocess input data, make predictions using the model, and return the results.
7. Deploy the Flask app with Docker
Run a Docker container using the previously built Docker image.
Expose the Flask app's port so that it's accessible via REST API.
Test the deployed Flask app by sending HTTP requests to the defined endpoints.
Note
Ensure to organize your codebase and directory structure appropriately.
Use appropriate error handling mechanisms in your Flask app.
Consider adding documentation and unit tests to your codebase for better maintainability and reliability.
This outline provides a high-level overview of the steps involved in completing the task. Each step will require detailed implementation based on your specific dataset and requirements. You can find numerous tutorials and resources online for each of these individual steps to guide you through the implementation process.
